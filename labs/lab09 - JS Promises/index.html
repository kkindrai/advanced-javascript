                    Creates two promises, one that resolves with an object response <code>Successful Promise: + results</code>,
                    and another that gets rejected with an error saying <code>Unable to Resolve Request + error</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each of these should be console.logged & console.errored appropriately

                <p>why is this card-body here? Great question. Maybe someday you'll get an answer, for now, however, we shall all be left with a slight, but ever present confusion within our souls. Pondering, questioning, what possibly could have drove this programming student to leave this in her homework? Maybe she was born with it, or maybe its Maybelline.</p>
